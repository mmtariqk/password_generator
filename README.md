A.  App Description:

Ay you know there are multiple ways to generate secure random password based on user-selected criteria. This web app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. In this password generation application I adopted the approach of programmer called Keep your code DRY/Dont's Repeat Yourself. This random strong password generator app UI is fully responsive on all screen devices viewports by using bootstrap, css media queries. After all this app will generate randome secure password once the user click on the generate password button. They will prompt multiple times with different options to include numbers, lowerCase, upperCase, special chacraters etc. for user the way they want to protect their sensitive data from non stakeholder. I addition, there is a minimum and maximum lenghth of the password i.e. 8 to 128 characters. There is an IF/Else Statement for user validation if they did not select the length. Confirm will popoup and will say This needs a value. So, they need to choose between them. Furthermore, this application consists of 8 main components. Means, generate button, the result area where the password will display, minimum and maximum length of password, includes uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, symbols and finally to copy password to your clipboard. And last but not the least there is an ALERT says your password copied to clipboard.
